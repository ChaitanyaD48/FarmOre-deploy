FarmOre is a farmer-friendly website that provides items from categories such as fruits and vegetables, groceries, seeds and fertilizers, and farm equipments, from one farm to another, building a connection between one and the other farmer(s) and bridging the gap between consumers and farmers. FarmOre aims in innovating the traditional Supply Chain system and introducing Tech in the Field of Agriculture which not only will reduce the wastage of Farm Products like Vegetables, Fruits, etc and also build a trust between an User and Farmer. Farmore is not only intended for the use of buyers but also for Farmers to buy various Farm Equipments, Pesicides and other required Items. We offer a live search feature so that users can browse a predetermined selection of products to find the ones they need. Each product has a comprehensive description and the name of the farm or business that is eager to sell it. Moreover, an online shopping cart feature keeps track of all the items the user intends to buy. We have also introduced a blog section where they can find numerous articles about farming and its varied practices. They would gain in-depth knowledge of the studies being conducted in their particular fields and access to the newest technologies that they could apply to increase yield.
